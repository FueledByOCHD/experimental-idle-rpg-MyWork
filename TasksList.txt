Tasks:


Task#1

in locations.js, rework:

get_total_effect() 
get_location_type_penalty

so that it also functions with flat effects (i.e. health_regenration_flat: (-2)), rather than just multipliers. 

Will need some adjustments to effects formatting on:
location_types 

Task#2

in main.js

Implement a new cast_magic function using { magic_templates } from "./magic.js"

function to be used for buff spells using active_effects from active_effects.js (similar to the "use_item" function) ,  but also for health or stamina restoration (relevant stats: character.stats.full["health"], and character.stats.full["stamina"]

it should call the use_mana function to expend mana_cost  

Task#3

Implement usable magic UI, to cast spells


section to change in index.HTML 

 <div id = "magic_list_div">
 <div id = "magic_list">
 
 and in display.js
 
 const magic_list = document.getElementById("magic_list");
